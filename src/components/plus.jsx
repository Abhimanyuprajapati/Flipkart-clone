            All You Need to Know About Flipkart Plus Membership
          </h1>
          <p>
            Flipkart customers receive extra benefits in the form of SuperCoins.
            Every month, Flipkart issues billions of SuperCoins for its regular
            customers. You will receive a Plus membership invitation once you
            have earned 200 SuperCoins in a calendar year. You must activate the
            invitation within 30 days of receiving it to have access to this
            Membership. You won't have to use SuperCoins in your account to
            activate this membership. Spending up to 100 rupees will get you two
            SuperCoins. You can earn up to 50 SuperCoins in a single order.
            Besides, SuperCoins can be used to profit from a variety of services
            and offerings. Flipkart has been working on bringing SuperCoins to
            the ecosystem since launching the concept in 2021. One move in this
            direction was the introduction of SuperCoin Pay and SuperCoin
            Exchange. For Indians, choosing to shop is an emotional decision,
            and rewarding it wholeheartedly creates a strong emotional
            connection with the business. This was a crucial realisation that
            prompted the development of this loyalty programme. The Flipkart
            Plus phenomenon is particularly pronounced in the heartland cities
            in Tier 2+ cities of India.
